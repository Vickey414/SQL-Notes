## Boosting
Boosting algorithms combine weak models trained sequentially to give more importance to the training samples on which the predictions are bad!
Boosting is a good way to turn a weak classifier into a strong classifier

The classifiers in bagging are dependent, while boosting us to turn several weak classifers into one strong classifer and is trained on sequential level.
