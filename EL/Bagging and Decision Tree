# Decision Tree
 Definition: A decision tree is a binary tree that recursively segment the input space X（also called the feature space）along the coordinate directions 
to create a set of K hyper-rectangles $R_k$ , k∈{1,...,K } as basic prediction units for ﬁtting constant values $\gamma_k$  within each of them.   
                  $f(x)$ = $\displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^k$$\gamma_k$ $1_{x∈R_k}$
 * Decision Tree are intuitive and easy to interpret. Such models are often called white box models.
  * In contrast, Random Forests are generally considered black box models. Black box make great predictions but it is usually hard to explain.  

## CART  
Definition: CART provides a partition of $R_2$ in classes by horizontal/vertical line segments.
