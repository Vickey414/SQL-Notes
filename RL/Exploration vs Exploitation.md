* Major Component of RL Agent
  * Policy: Agent behavior function. It is mapping the state what you are in into the action you take.  
            We evaluate it a good or bad policy in terms of its expected discounted sum of reward.
    * Deterministic policy: $a = \pi(s)$
      There is simply one action per state
    * Stochastic policy: $\pi(a|s) = P[A_t = a | S_t =s]$
      You can have distribution over actions you may take.
  * Value function: Future reward from being in a state /or action when following a particular policy.  
    $v_\pi (s) = E[G_t | S_t = t] = E[R_t+1 + R_t+2 + R_t+3 + ...| S_t = t]$ 
  * Model: The representation of the world and how that changes in respond to the agent's behavior.
