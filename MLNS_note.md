* 
The idea may be finding some missing eadge.

> * Measure similarity of two graphs  
>> - Graph similarity and graph classification  
>> - why shall we measure the similarity of two graphs?

> * Identify densely connected clusters of nodes  
>> - Clustering and community detection  
>> - Identify user with the same interest.  
>> - Example: Social circle detection in social media


*  graph generation (drug discovery/generate graph with the same character).
*  graph evolution (simulations)


### Examples of network graph
*  Traffic Prediction
*  Recommender Systems
*  The Protein Folding Problem
*  Social Circal Detection
