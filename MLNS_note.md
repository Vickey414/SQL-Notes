### L1 Ways to analyze network data

* 
The idea may be finding some missing eadge.

> * Measure similarity of two graphs  
>> - Graph similarity and graph classification  
>> - why shall we measure the similarity of two graphs?

> * Identify densely connected clusters of nodes  
>> - Clustering and community detection  
>> - Identify user with the same interest.  
>> - Example: Social circle detection in social media


*  graph generation (drug discovery/generate graph with the same character).
*  graph evolution (simulations)


### Examples of network graph
*  Traffic Prediction
*  Recommender Systems
*  The Protein Folding Problem
*  Social Circal Detection

Undirect graph: The Adjacncy Matrix is symmetric.
Directed graph: The Adjacncy Matrix is nonsymmetric.

Complete graph: A graph G = (V, E) is called complete Kn if every pair of nodes is connected by an edge
$$


### Graph traversal algorithms

#### Breadth-first search (BFS)

#### Depth-First Search (DFS)

#### Connected Components
Definition: A connected component is a maximal connected subgraph of a graph G (there is a path between any pair of nodes)



#### Key Network Properties
Degree distribution: P(k)
Path length: h
Clustering coefficient: C


Number of Paths
使用Adjacncy Matrix to compute


Network Diameter measure how spread of the network
